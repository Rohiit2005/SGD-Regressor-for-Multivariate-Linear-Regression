# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Initialize weights and bias randomly and set the learning rate
2. For each training example, calculate the prediction and compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to weights and bias.
3. Update weights and bias using the gradient: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1767894-2972-42d1-92d1-90143b24afc6)

4. Repeat until convergence or for a fixed number of iterations.

## Program:
